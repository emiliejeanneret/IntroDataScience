# Introduction

Have you ever seen a Disney movie ? I am sure that you cannot respond "no" to that question. If you really never have seen one, I bet that you know the worldwide famous mouse (of course I am speaking of Mickey Mouse). And this is because [The Walt Disney Company](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company) is, since 2012, the first group of entertainment across the world ! Now talking a little bit about the history of this company, we know that is has been created in 1923 (100 years next year ! **woaw**). The founders are Roy and Walter Disney, but the latter is the main character in the Disney history.

They create many types of movie and you can easily find your way through it. Indeed, it's adapted to the whole family. The number of movies they produced is about *529*, that is huge ! [The list](https://www.imdb.com/list/ls033609554/) of all movie would take quite a lot of time to go through but the main element we are interested in in this research are the income of each movie, and the genre of each movie.

## Research question

This research is interested in the evolution of incomings of Disney movies through time. We also want to see is there is an impact of the genre of movie on the income they engender. Of course, we will need to adapt the table with inflation rate in order to adapt our data. The main question here is **Is there an impact of the genre of Disney movies incomings over time ?**

## Hypothesis

N0: There is no impact of the genre on the incoming

N1: There is an impact of the genre on the incoming

# Data

```{r, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
read.csv("disney_movies_total_gross.csv", sep=";")
df <- read.csv("disney_movies_total_gross.csv", sep=";")
release_month <- df$release_month
genre<- df$genre
```

# Analysis
```{r, include=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(df, aes(genre, release_month)) +
  geom_tile()
```
